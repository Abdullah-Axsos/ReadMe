# Data Science Projects – Axsos Academy

This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of the training program at Axsos Academy. Each project applies real-world data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve practical problems and gain actionable insights.

---

## Objectives

The main goals of these projects are to:

- Practice core data science workflows using real datasets  
- Enhance skills in data cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing  
- Build and evaluate machine learning and statistical models  
- Communicate findings effectively through notebooks and summaries  
- Apply problem-solving and critical thinking using data-driven approaches

## Projects Included

### 1. Prediction of Product Sales
This project aims to predict future product sales using historical sales data. It includes:

- Data exploration and visualization  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering  
- Training regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation and comparison  
- Providing business recommendations based on the results

### 3. Chicago Crime Data Analysis (2001–2022)
This project analyzes crime trends in Chicago from 2001 to 2022 and forecasts future crime patterns. It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analysis of crime distribution by year, district, and time of day  
- Time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models  
- Prediction of crime rates for upcoming months  
- Visualizations and insights to support public safety planning
