# Data Science Projects – Axsos Academy

This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed as part of the training program at Axsos Academy. Each project focuses on applying real-world data analysis and machine learning techniques to explore, model, and derive insights from datasets across different domains.

---

## Objectives

The main goals of these projects are to:

- Practice key data science workflows using real datasets  
- Strengthen skills in data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering  
- Apply machine learning and statistical modeling techniques  
- Interpret and communicate findings through notebooks and reports  
- Develop problem-solving and critical thinking using data

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Chicago Crime Data Analysis (2001–2022)
- Exploratory analysis of crime patterns in Chicago  
- Time series forecasting using ARIMA/SARIMA models  
- Crime trend prediction to support law enforcement planning

### 2. [Add Another Project Title Here]
- Description of the second project goes here (e.g., sales prediction, customer segmentation, etc.)

### 3. [Add Another Project Title Here]
- Description of the third project goes here (e.g., product recommendation, sentiment analysis, etc.)

*Each project is self-contained in its own Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and documentation.*
